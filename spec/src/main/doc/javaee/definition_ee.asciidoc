[[concepts_ee]]

== Extended Concepts for Java EE

When using CDI in a Java EE container the following concepts apply in addition to those defined in <<concepts>>:

* A Java EE component is a _bean_ if the lifecycle of its instances may be managed by the container according to the lifecycle context model defined in <<contexts>>
* Contextual instances of a bean may be used in EL expressions that are evaluated in the same context
* For some Java EE components - like environment resources, defined in <<resources>>  - the container provides bean implementation

[[capabilities_ee]]

=== Functionality provided by the container to the bean in Java EE

In addition to the capabilities defined in <<capabilities>>, in Java EE, a bean is provided by the container with the following capability:

* scoped resolution by bean name when used in a Unified EL expression, as defined by <<name_resolution>>.

[[bean_types_ee]]

=== Bean types for Java EE component

As managed beans, EJB session beans may have multiple bean types depending on their client-visible types. For instance, this session bean has only the local interfaces +BookShop+ and +Auditable+, along with +Object+, as bean types, since the bean class is not a client-visible type.
                                                                                                                        
[source, java]
----
@Stateful 
public class BookShopBean 
        extends Business 
        implements BookShop, Auditable { 
    ... 
}
----

The rules for determining the (unrestricted) set of bean types for Java EE components are defined in  <<session_bean_types>> and <<resource_types>>.


[[default_bean_discovery_ee]]
=== Default bean discovery mode for Java EE

In addition to rules listed in <<default_bean_discovery>>, if the _bean discovery mode_ is `annotated` in Java EE, then:

* bean classes of EJB sessions beans, are not discovered, and
* producer methods that are not on an EJB session bean are not discovered, and
* producer fields that are not on an EJB session bean are not discovered, and
* disposer methods that are not on an EJB session bean are not discovered, and
* observer methods that are not on an EJB session bean are not discovered.


[[names_ee]]
=== Bean names in Java EE

A bean with a name may be referred to by its name in Unified EL expressions.

There is no relationship between the bean name of an EJB session bean and the EJB name of the bean.

Bean names allow the direct use of beans in JSP or JSF pages, as defined in <<el>>. For example, a bean with the name +products+ could be used like this:

[source, xml]
----
<h:outputText value="#{products.total}"/>
----

[[default_name_ee]]

==== Default bean names for EJB session beans

In the circumstances listed in <<default_name>>, the rule for determining default name for an EJB session bean are defined in <<session_bean_name>>.
