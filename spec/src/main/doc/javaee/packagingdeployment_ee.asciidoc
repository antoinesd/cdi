[[bean_archive_ee]]
=== Bean archive with EJB Session Beans

When running in Java EE, The following additional rules to those defined in <<bean_archive>> apply:

* An implicit bean archive may also contains EJB session beans, and
* if an archive meet the requirements to be an _implicit bean archive_ but doesn't contain any bean class with a bean defining annotation and have at least one EJB sessions beans, it's an _implicit bean archive_.

When determining which archives are bean archives, the container must also consider:

* EJB jars or application client jars
* The +WEB-INF/classes+ directory of a war

The container is not required to support application client jar bean archives.

A Java EE container is required by the Java EE specification to support Java EE modules.

In a war, the +beans.xml+ file must be named:

* +WEB-INF/beans.xml+  or +WEB-INF/classes/META-INF/beans.xml+.

If a war has a file named +beans.xml+ in both the +WEB-INF+ directory and in the +WEB-INF/classes/META-INF+ directory, then non-portable behavior results. Portable applications must have a +beans.xml+ file in only one of the +WEB-INF+ or the +WEB-INF/classes/META-INF+ directories.

The following additional rules apply regarding container search for beans:

* In an application deployed as an ear, the container searches every bean archive bundled with or referenced by the ear, including bean archives bundled with or referenced by wars, EJB jars and rars contained in the ear. The bean archives might be library jars, EJB jars or war +WEB-INF/classes+ directories.
* In an application deployed as a war, the container searches every bean archive bundled with or referenced by the war. The bean archives might be library jars or the +WEB-INF/classes+ directory.
* In an application deployed as an EJB jar, the container searches the EJB jar, if it is a bean archive, and every bean archive referenced by the EJB jar.
* In an application deployed as a rar, the container searches every bean archive bundled with or referenced by the rar.
* An embeddable EJB container searches each bean archive in the JVM classpath that is listed in the value of the embeddable container initialization property +javax.ejb.embeddable.modules+, or every bean archive in the JVM classpath if the property is not specified. The bean archives might be directories, library jars or EJB jars.


[[type_bean_discovery_ee]]

=== Type and Bean discovery for EJB

In Java EE, the container automatically discovers EJB session beans in bean archives like it does for managed bean as defined in <<type_bean_discovery>>.
