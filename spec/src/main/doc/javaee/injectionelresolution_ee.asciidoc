=== Dependency injection in Java EE

In addition to rules defined in <<injection>>, in Java EE, the container is also required to perform dependency injection whenever it creates one of the following objects:

* contextual instances of EJB session beans,
* non-contextual instances of EJB session beans (for example, session beans obtained by the application from JNDI or injected using +@EJB+), and
* instances of any other Java EE component class supporting injection.

A Java EE 5 container is not required to support injection for non-contextual objects.
